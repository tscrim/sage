    # This job first checks whether "configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url"

    # In this way, we check that all necessary package tarballs
    # have already been uploaded to the Sage server at the time
    # of pushing a release tag.
    #
    # It also uses "bootstrap -D", thus checking that the "configure"
    # tarball has been uploaded to the Sage server at the time
    # of pushing a release tag.
