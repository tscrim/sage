# This file is run by Sage when initializing libgap via GAP_Initialize, and may
# contain bug fixes/workarounds and/or any Sage-specific patches necessary for
# Sage's libgap interface.


# Load the GAP packages that GAP itself tries to autoload in the
# default configuration (see "PackagesToLoad" in lib/package.gi). The
# combination of passing -A to gap and these LoadPackage statements
# allows us to load the usual set of packages, but only if they are
# installed. So most people will get exactly the default behavior,
# but minimal installations won't throw warnings and fail tests.
#
# We also temporarily lower the InfoLevel of the InfoWarning class so
# that e.g.,
#
#  #I  polycyclic package is not available. Check that the name is correct
#  #I  and it is present in one of the GAP root directories (see '??RootPaths')
#
# is not output to the console.
